# AlgoBrain
A research project in college supervised by Undergraduates Research Forum at Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University.

## Details
In this paper we will make a comparison between the classical approach to obtain that and the magic bitboard approach and we will provide the reader with C++ implementation for the magic approach as we aim to provide programmers who write chess engines a discussion of one of the fastest and most versatile movebitboard generators for individual sliding pieces.

## Implementation
We found a library already implemented for the magical approach <a href="https://github.com/goutham/magic-bits">here</a> and you will find the implementation for the classical approach in our repo.

## Future Work
* Providing the assembly code for both classical and magical approach.
* Providing the exact time for both classical and magical approach.
